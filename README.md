# KURVE â€“ KI-unterstÃ¼tzte Recherche und Verarbeitung von Stellungnahmen

This repository contains our solution for the **KURVE Hackathon Project**, developed in collaboration with **THWS Master AI WÃ¼rzburg**.  
The goal is to support public administrations by automating the analysis and summarization of large volumes of non-formally structured public statements.

## ðŸ§  Problem Statement: Automating the Processing of Public Statements

Public authorities frequently receive thousands of statements during public participation procedures (sometimes up to 100,000). These must be reviewed individually, which is time-consuming and inefficient. Many statements are redundant or off-topic, and manual processing leads to delays.

### Key Challenges
- Reading documents in PDF format, including OCR and handwritten content.
- Separating and identifying individual complaints/statements.
- Clustering and summarizing content while removing redundancy.
- Ensuring traceability from summaries back to individual sources.
- Anonymizing sensitive or personal data.
- Generating structured "consideration documents" for planning authorities.
- Guaranteeing data protection throughout the entire process.

## ðŸ’¡ Our Solution

We built an AI-assisted pipeline that extracts, processes, and summarizes the main points from each submitted statement, providing a scalable and semi-automated solution to accelerate public administration workflows.

### ðŸ§¾ Document Processing

- Input documents were provided in **PDF format**.
- Each PDF was **parsed and segmented** into individual **complaints/statements**.
- Text-based PDFs were supported.

### ðŸ§¹ Anonymization with NER

- We used **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** to detect and anonymize **personally identifiable information**.

### ðŸ“š Clustering & Summarization with LLAMA3

- We used **LLAMA3** to generate **summaries** of the complaints.
- Semantic **clustering** was performed to group similar complaints (based on content and topic).
- Clusters were processed into concise summaries, ensuring all concerns were addressed without redundancy.

### ðŸ“„ Output: Consideration Document

- The final result is a structured **summary document**, grouped by:
  - Thematic content (e.g., water, forests, traffic)
  - Specific project areas
  - Special or individual concerns
- Each summary links back to the relevant original complaint(s) to ensure **traceability**.

### âœ… Impact

Our pipeline significantly reduces the **manual workload** and **processing time** required to evaluate public statements. It also increases the **transparency** and **consistency** of the evaluation process.
